# ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-DESIGN-BY-PROTEUS-USING-ARDUINO-UNO

# Introduction:
The automotive industry is undergoing a paradigm shift towards sustainable transportation 
solutions, with electric vehicles (EVs) emerging as a forefront contender. This transition is driven 
by a collective effort to mitigate environmental impact and reduce dependence on fossil fuels. 
As EV technology continues to evolve, there is a growing emphasis on integrating innovative 
features and control mechanisms to enhance functionality and user experience.
In line with this trajectory, our project focuses on the design and simulation of an electric vehicle 
prototype using Proteus simulation software and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. This endeavor 
seeks to demonstrate the feasibility and versatility of incorporating advanced control systems 
into EVs, thereby elevating their performance and usability.

# Abstract:
The evolution of electric vehicles (EVs) has reshaped the automotive industry, emphasizing 
sustainability and innovation in transportation technology. This project focuses on the 
development and simulation of an electric vehicle prototype using Proteus simulation software 
and an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The prototype is equipped with essential features such as 
PWM speed control using a potentiometer for precise speed adjustments, intuitive left-right 
forward-reverse navigation buttons for seamless maneuverability, and an automatic left-right 
indicator light system to enhance safety and signaling capabilities. Through this project, we aim 
to showcase the integration of advanced control mechanisms and automation in electric vehicle 
design, paving the way for future advancements in sustainable mobility solutions.
